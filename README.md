# TwitterScraper

This Repository has different options for scraping data from Twitter.

1. Twitter Scraper with TwitterScraper
  
I'm using a library called TwitterScraper built specifically for what it is called. I believe it works pretty well. There are 2 things you can focus on when scraping the data. You can use the Twitter handle of an individual or you can use a keywor/phrase.

I think this was a really good option and returned a large amount of data.

2. Twitter Scraper with BeautifulSoup

This method used BeautifulSoup and I don't think this one worked as well for me. I was only able to retrieve 20 tweets at a time. I am not sure the reason for this, but if someone figures it out please let me know or make a contribution to my code. I do not recommmend this way of scraping data, but I left it here if this is something you want to try out.
